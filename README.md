## Hello!

**My name is [AdriÃ¡n Lorenzo](https://adrianlorenzo.dev)** and I live in Gran Canaria, Spain, with my family! 

I currently work as **Chief Innovation Officer at [The Agile Monkeys](https://www.theagilemonkeys.com)**.

I love **Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Software Engineering**, but I enjoy everything related to computer science (For example, metaprogramming, discrete optimization, and security).

I have experience working in:

- Information Retrieval (Extractive and Generative)
- Language Understanding
- Knowledge Representation
- Pattern Recognition
- Semantics Analysis and Extraction

Some of the programming languages that I enjoy using and that I have used a lot are **Python, Swift, Go, Kotlin, C/C++, Java, Typescript, and Rust.** Other relevant tools, like frameworks, libraries, and services that I have used to work on my projects are: 

- **Machine learning**: Tensorflow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pillow, ðŸ¤—datasets, ðŸ¤—transformers
- **Data:** Numpy, Pandas, Delta Lake
- **Vector Storage:** FAISS, Annoy, Weaviate
- **Virtualization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Workflows and pipelines:** Apache Airflow
- **Backend applications**: Spring Framework, Gin, Nest.js, FastAPI, Flask
- **User interfaces**: SwiftUI, Swift Combine, Android Jetpack, Kotlin Coroutines, UIKit, React
- **Cloud providers**: Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Azure

I don't feel linked to any technology emotionally. **I use them as tools to achieve an objective, but my objective is not to use them.** With all of them, I have worked on several projects related to Machine Learning and Software Engineering.

**I'm open to helping and collaborating on things that can bring value to the community.** If that is the case, don't hesitate to get in touch with me.

If you want to get in touch with me, **you can contact me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianlorenzomelian/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xAdrianLorenzo).**
